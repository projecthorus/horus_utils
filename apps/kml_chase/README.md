# KML Payload Data Server

This folder contains code to display payload (and chase car!) position data in Google Earth, or anything else that can handle 'live' KML data.

This is very much a work-in-progress, with much to be completed. For now, the following works:

To listen for payload data from OziMux (i.e. on UDP:localhost:8942):
```
$ python kml_server.py --ozimux
```

To listen for payload data via the UDP broadcast 'Payload Summary' messages (which can be generated by OziMux, but also by radiosonde_auto_rx):
```
$ python kml_server.py --summary
```

Once running, load the `payload_position.kml` file in Google Earth, and it should start auto-updating.

 * Make kml_server close properly on CTRL+C
 * Predictions!
